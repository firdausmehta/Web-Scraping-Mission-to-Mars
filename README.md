## Outline
I have built a web application that scrapes various websites for data related to the Mission to Mars and displays the information in a single HTML page. Flask is used to deploy the scraped data to the HTML. A `Scrape New Data` button is created to scrape Mars-related data from the websites listed below.

## Data
- [NASA Mars News Site](https://redplanetscience.com/)<br>
- [JPL Featured Space Image](https://spaceimages-mars.com/)<br>
- [Mars Facts Webpage](https://galaxyfacts-mars.com/)<br>
- [Mars Facts Hemispheres](https://marshemispheres.com/)
